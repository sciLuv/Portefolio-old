# portefolio
projet of a personnal web page to present my work (abandoned).

update june 2022 : abandon the projet for multiple reasons : 
misuse of JS for animation doable with CSS, design too "old" and overload.
No use of bootstraps for base of the website.

nethertheless i note work on the clickable element of the menu, and algorithm to change gradually the color background of the page.
